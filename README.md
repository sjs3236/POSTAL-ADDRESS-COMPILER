# POSTAL-ADDRESS-COMPILER

## Overview
The process of converting an input file to an understandable format is called parsing. Generally, it is divided into two parts. First, lexical analysis tokenizes the input through the lexical scanner. The second, parsing, generates an abstract model of the tokens and then generates useful content from that model. I wrote a parser using the flex tool for vocabulary analysis and the bison tool for parsing.
The goal of the program is to parse an input file that contains postal addresses and then to output a representation of those addresses in XML.
